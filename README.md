# Libraries
Collection of libraries used for data analysis of nuclear experiments

This is a collection of useful functions and classes I use in my data analysis, especially for the data analysis of the 166Ho and 167Ho data.
If you want to recreate the results, clone the repository to a folder, and add the folder to your pythonpath, so that the files can be accessed by the data analysis codes.
